# Statistical-learning-Project

## Overview

This project was completed for the Statistical Learning course that I took in the spring of 2025. It includes two key machine learning tasks: predicting final student grades (regression) and classifying individuals by obesity risk (classification). Each task includes multiple models, evaluation metrics, and analysis.


## Task 1: Final Grade Prediction (Regression)

### Objective
Predict final grades of students based on academic and behavioral features.

## Models Used
- **Model 1:** Linear Regression (assumed)
- **Model 2:** Decision Tree Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- RÂ² Score

### Key Takeaways
- Decision Trees helped capture non-linear patterns.
- Linear Regression provided a good baseline.
- Visualization of features helped interpret impact on grades.



## Task 2: Obesity Prediction (Classification)

### Objective
Classify individuals into obesity categories using lifestyle, health, and demographic data.

### Models Used
- **Model 1:** Logistic Regression
- **Model 2:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

### Key Takeaways
- KNN performed well with normalized data.
- Logistic Regression was interpretable and reliable.
- Confusion matrix and classification report revealed class imbalances.
